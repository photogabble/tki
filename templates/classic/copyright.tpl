<p>The Kabal Invasion forked from "Blacknova Traders". <br><br>
The lead programmer for TKI (thekabal) was for over a decade actively involved in the development of BNT.<br><br>
TKI contains code from Ron Harwood, the original developer of BNT, along with code from dozens of contributors to BNT, and many contributors to NGS/TKI (The first iteration of TKI).<br><br>
For brevity, we have noted these in the source code files as "Portions also Copyright The Blacknova Development team".<br><br>
The Kabal Invasion development team is deeply appreciative for all of the contributions made to these projects.<br><br>
