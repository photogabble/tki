We have committed a number of additional tools that are useful to development in the tools/ directory.

phpcs is PHP Code Sniffer. It examines code against a set of standards. The usage we are closest to so far is php tools/phpcs.phar --standard=PSR1 classes/ 
Please note that running it against the main TKI directory will usually result in an out of memory error. Instead create a subdirectory, move some files there,
and test them. We have a *long* way to go on these standards, but are slowly making progress towards some of them. Please note that we do not intend to meet all
of the standards. The bracket rules in the PSR standards, for example, is not something we will be complying with.

php-cs-fixer strives to automatically correct code for specific items in the PSR standard. We do not currently use it, but may in the future use it as a pre-commit hook.

phpmd is PHP Mess Detector. It examines code for a variety of issues, almost all of which are guidelines that have to be interpreted. However, we have made 
excellent progress towards the usage: php tools/phpmd.phar classes/ text unusedcode
There are other command-line options (try them!), with varying levels of usefulness to our project.
