We have committed a number of additional tools that are useful to development in the tools/ directory.

phpcs is PHP Code Sniffer. It examines code against a set of standards. The usage we are closest to so far is php tools/phpcs.phar --standard=tools/phpcs.xml *.php 
We have a way to go on these standards, but are slowly making progress towards some of them.

php-cs-fixer strives to automatically correct code for specific items in the PSR standard. We do not currently use it, but may in the future use it as a pre-commit hook.

phpmd is PHP Mess Detector. It examines code for a variety of issues, almost all of which are guidelines that have to be interpreted. However, we have made 
excellent progress towards the usage: php tools/phpmd.phar . text unusedcode,tools/phpmd.xml --exclude vendor/,templates/,tools/
There are other command-line options (try them!), with varying levels of usefulness to our project.
