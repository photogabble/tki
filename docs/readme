Requirements: 
- MySQL version 5.5.3 minimum is required (needed for utf8mb4 schemas).
- PHP's mbstring extension must be installed (used in common.php)
- PHP's pdo extension must be installed (used in create_universe, and soon the rest of the game)
- Web browser - Recent versons of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome are best, but we also support Internet Explorer 9 or above - Older versions of Internet Explorer will have degraded functionality.
- Apache version 2.2.22+ is supported, we have not determined a required minimum.
- IIS is not supported, and TKI will likely not work correctly on it in future versions.
- Development "Snapshots" are intended only for developers that are actively involved in the development process, and require additional effort to work (composer, etc)
- PHP version 5.5 is suggested. PHP 5.3 is end of life, and no longer supported by the PHP team. Despite those issues, it is possible to run TKI on 5.3.7 and above.
(For Smarty, password_hash for login, directoryIterator, and many other features). Any version below 5.3.7 is not supported and is unlikely to work.

Credits:
    The Kabal Invasion forked from Blacknova Traders, please visit their sourceforge page for more information about their project.

    This game concept is based on the old BBS games that went by many names
    (Tradewars, Galactic Warzone, Yankee Trader, Ultimate Universe, and
    many other names like this) but shares no code with them.  It is
    written 100% in PHP/HTML/SQL.
