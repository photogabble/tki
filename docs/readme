Requirements: 
- MySQL version 5.5.3 minimum is required (needed for utf8mb4 schemas).
- PHP's mbstring extension must be installed (used in common.php)
- PHP's pdo extension must be installed (used in create_universe, and soon the rest of the game)
- Web browser - Firefox and Chrome (v30+ for both) are best, while Safari (v6+) is also good. Internet Explorer needs to be at least (v9+).
- Apache version 2.2.22+ is supported, we have not determined a required minimum. TKI will likely run on lighttpd and nginix, but has not been tested on either.
- Development "Snapshots" are intended only for developers that are actively involved in the development process, and require additional effort to work (composer, etc)
- PHP version 7+ is required (random_int used throughout).
- IIS is NOT supported, please do not ask!

Credits:
    The Kabal Invasion forked from Blacknova Traders, please visit their sourceforge page for more information about their project.

    This game concept is based on the old BBS games that went by many names
    (Tradewars, Galactic Warzone, Yankee Trader, Ultimate Universe, and
    many other names like this) but shares no code with them.  It is
    written 100% in PHP/HTML/SQL.
