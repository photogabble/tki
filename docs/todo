This file is used to keep track of things that we intend on doing, and all accepted feature requests.

TODO denotes an item that we intend to work on. FREQ indicates a feature request.

TODO: Remove hard-coding force to mysql, so that we can do postgresql
TODO: Remove abstraction from templates, Smarty only. Consider whether we'd want Twig instead, however
TODO: Add isset & filter_input combo to *all* inputs
TODO: Make config variables relating to max value have a consistent naming scheme (max_ v. _max)
TODO: Scheduler should have a check to ensure that each player does not have more presets (total/count) than preset_max
TODO: Sector fighter should be redone so that it is class driven, but its going to take extensive testing to do so
TODO: CU, admin, and scheduler should all be class-driven, and should have a database entry for active/inactive on each sub-item. This will also eliminate the need for direct access checks.
TODO: ship.php could have a better error message for handling when you navigate to it directly (instead of from main, when a ship has been detected)
TODO: Switch common and footer to use pdo only for all its calls
TODO: Convert all SQL calls from adodb to PDO
TODO: Audit all SQL calls to ensure they use row & value style calls, and also use a debug call
TODO: Add encryption on submission for admin panel and login
TODO: Redo scheduler to be a subdirectory (like admin) with activated scheduler events
TODO: Language translations for all elements in scheduler
TODO: Merge mail.php and mailto.php
TODO: Cleanup functions and calls in scheduler
TODO: Eliminate $color_line variables
TODO: Convert main to be template driven
TODO: Finish moving Sol from sector 0 to sector 1
TODO: Implement Post->Redirect->Get pattern for the 60 post calls in the game
TODO: Eliminate all reg_globals equivalent hacks
FREQ: Migrate all files to use templates
TODO: Postgresql compatibility
TODO: Split ships table from players table
TODO: Review schema for improvements (BIGINT, more indexes, reduce unstructured data, etc)
TODO: Add new variable for admin to set that provides http/https independent source for images/css/js/etc. Basically supporting a CDN. Variable can be handled much like template is.
